            Software work has significantly evolved over the past decades, and
            the demand for software professionals has skyrocketed. According to
            a report published in 2023, Finland will need 200,000 new software
            professionals by 2030. However, the development of artificial
            intelligence, particularly generative language models like ChatGPT,
            has rapidly changed the landscape. In 2025, advanced language models
            are expected to handle routine programming tasks and surpass the
            skills of the best programmers.
          </p>

          <p>
            This development does not imply that humans will lose their roles in
            the software industry; rather, the nature of the work will change.
            Industry leaders and researchers predict that in the future, there
            will be little need for novice and mid-level software engineers,
            with demand focusing primarily on top-tier experts.
          </p>

          <p>
            The breakthrough in AI has also transformed the nature of work and
            accelerated the pace of software development. This creates
            challenges in terms of employee motivation, well-being, and ensuring
            organizational competitiveness. The impact of AI on the workplace is
            not merely technological but constitutes an unpredictable
            socio-technical shift.
          </p>

          <p>
            The project investigates the impact of AI on software work and
            collaborates with companies to develop a vision for sustainable and
            human-centered software work. Solutions are sought for current
            challenges such as the skills shortage and workload management, as
            well as for long-term transformations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The project enhances participants' ability to anticipate,
            understand, and prepare for various futures, learn by experimenting
            with new work methods, and develop skills and competences.
            Additionally, it provides guidelines for management, HR, and
            operational teams, and improves companies' ethical and
            responsibility competencies in the face of the AI revolution. The
            project supports employee well-being and motivation, encourages
            creativity and enthusiasm, and strengthens ethical and responsible
            productivity growth.
