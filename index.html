    <h2>Project description</h2>
    <p>Software work has significantly evolved over the past decades, and the demand for software professionals has skyrocketed. According to a report published in 2023, Finland will need 200,000 new software professionals by 2030. However, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly generative language models like ChatGPT, has rapidly changed the landscape. In 2025, advanced language models are expected to handle routine programming tasks and surpass the skills of the best programmers. </p> 

<p>This development does not imply that humans will lose their roles in the software industry; rather, the nature of the work will change. Industry leaders and researchers predict that in the future, there will be little need for novice and mid-level software engineers, with demand focusing primarily on top-tier experts.  <p>

<p>The breakthrough in AI has also transformed the nature of work and accelerated the pace of software development. This creates challenges in terms of employee motivation, well-being, and ensuring organizational competitiveness. The impact of AI on the workplace is not merely technological but constitutes an unpredictable socio-technical shift.  </p>

<p>The project investigates the impact of AI on software work and collaborates with companies to develop a vision for sustainable and human-centered software work. Solutions are sought for current challenges such as the skills shortage and workload management, as well as for long-term transformations. </p> 

<p>The project enhances participants' ability to anticipate, understand, and prepare for various futures, learn by experimenting with new work methods, and develop skills and tcompetences. Additionally, it provides guidelines for management, HR, and operational teams, and improves companies' ethical and responsibility competencies in the face of the AI revolution. The project supports employee well-being and motivation, encourages creativity and enthusiasm, and strengthens ethical and responsible productivity growth. </p>
