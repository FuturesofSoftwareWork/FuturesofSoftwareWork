"summary": "Block’s Goose project argues that the key skill is shifting from prompt engineering to context engineering: shaping persistent, structured context so agents can reliably do multi-step work. The post emphasizes that AI changes the definition of “done” from “code runs” to “workflows verified and operationalized,” pushing engineers toward end-to-end thinking. The business impact is that high performers become those who can orchestrate context, tools, and verification—not just implement features.",

"whyItMatters": [
"AI adoption shifts skill demand toward writing durable context (docs, runbooks, interfaces) that compounds across work.",
"Teams with strong context practices can scale agent usage while reducing hallucinations and rework.",
"This reframes documentation and platform engineering as direct productivity multipliers."
],
"recommendedActions": [
"Create a “context budget” initiative: upgrade runbooks, architecture notes, and operational docs used by agents.",
"Standardize repo-level agent guidance (agents.md/CLAUDE.md) and keep it current via code review.",
"Train engineers on verification loops (tests, staging checks, observability) as part of agent-first workflows."
],
"risksAndCaveats": [
"“Context engineering” can become a buzzword; ensure changes are tied to measurable failure/retry reductions.",
"More context can also mean more noise if not curated—quality and structure matter."
