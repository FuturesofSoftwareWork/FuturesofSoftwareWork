Let’s start with an admission: **project websites are not hot stuff in 2026**.

If you’re building anything remotely modern, your “presence” is more likely to be a living doc, a community channel, a slide deck that keeps evolving, or a handful of posts that travel better on other platforms than they do on your own domain. A website can feel like a relic—static, formal, and slightly beside the point.

And yet, after giving this some real thought, we identified a clear need that kept showing up in our work.

## We’re overwhelmed—by data, by opinions, by constant change

Over the last year, the volume of stories about how AI changes software work has exploded. Every week brings new tools, new workflows, new “best practices,” and new claims about productivity jumps, agent architectures, and the future of engineering roles.

Some of it is insightful. Some of it is hype. A lot of it is ambiguous.

More importantly: the information isn’t centralized. The signal is spread across:

- personal blogs and GitHub READMEs
- vendor changelogs and product launches
- conference talks, demos, and recorded streams
- social media threads and hot takes
- YouTube breakdowns, LinkedIn posts, Discord chats, podcasts

It’s a constant drip-feed of “something changed” without a stable baseline of _what matters_, _what’s credible_, and _what to do about it_.

## The credibility trap: publications arrive late

We still value studies, reports, and reputable publications. But there’s a structural mismatch with a fast-moving ecosystem:

- by the time an article is published, **the data behind it is often at least a year old**
- by the time a report is widely cited, **the tooling landscape has already shifted**
- by the time a “best practice” is written up, **teams have already moved on to new failure modes**

This doesn’t make publications useless—it just means they’re not sufficient for operational decision-making in a world that changes week-to-week.

## The monitoring problem: staying informed is starting to feel like a second job

So we try to keep up the modern way.

And what does that actually look like?

It looks like being flooded with news and spending evenings in front of phones—scrolling social media, watching YouTube breakdowns, skimming LinkedIn posts, reading blogs, opening repo docs—trying to understand **what the heck is happening**.

That’s not sustainable. And it’s not a good way to make decisions.

The cost isn’t just time. It’s cognitive strain:

- constant context switching
- decision fatigue
- inconsistent adoption (“we tried it once”)
- tool sprawl driven by visibility rather than fit
- reduced quality of judgment because there’s no bandwidth left to verify

## The insight: we don’t need more content—we need curation

We realized the core problem wasn’t a lack of information. It was the opposite.

**We have too much information and too little synthesis.**

What we need is a lightweight way to monitor development in a fast-paced world—without turning every engineer and every partner into an always-on analyst.

That’s where curation becomes operational infrastructure.

Not “a newsletter.” Not “marketing.” Not “a content strategy.”

A practical function that answers:

- _What changed?_
- _Why does it matter?_
- _How strong is the evidence?_
- _What should we do next (pilot / watch / ignore)?_

## Why this website exists

That’s why we have this website.

Not because we think a project site is trendy, but because we saw a concrete need for **curated content for our project and partners**:

- a shared baseline of what matters right now
- a way to triage signal vs. hype
- a record of what we tried and what we learned
- templates and guardrails we can reuse instead of reinventing
- a consistent cadence that reduces individual cognitive load

If we do this well, the outcome is simple: less noise, better decisions, and faster learning—with fewer late nights doomscrolling to keep up.

## Main takeaways for leaders

1. **The biggest cost of fast change is cognitive strain.** Scattered signals create context switching and decision fatigue that degrade judgment and adoption quality.
2. **Publications are valuable—but operationally late.** In a weekly-changing ecosystem, “authoritative” often means “already outdated.”
3. **Monitoring must be designed.** Without a system, staying informed becomes a second job—and a source of tool sprawl.
4. **Curation is attention infrastructure.** A shared digest + living templates convert chaos into deliberate learning.
5. **This site is our mechanism for alignment.** It’s a curated signal feed for our project and partners—so we can move fast without losing coherence.
