    "As algorithms take over the syntax of software, the semantics\u2014the meaning and purpose\u2014become the exclusive domain of human engineers. We must pivot our education systems similarly to how architecture evolved from structural engineering into a holistic discipline.",
    "The shift is not merely about learning new tools. It is about cultivating a fundamentally different relationship with technology\u2014one rooted in empathy, contextual understanding, and ethical reasoning.",
    "Our research at VTT suggests that teams scoring highest on collaboration and communication metrics consistently outperform those focused purely on technical output, even when the latter group has access to more advanced AI tooling."
