"title": "Simon Willison’s link roundup: Scaling long-running autonomous coding (Cursor) and the browser-from-scratch experiment",
"summary": "In his January 19 roundup, Simon Willison highlights Cursor’s experiments running many concurrent coding agents on a single project and using planner/worker/judge patterns to coordinate work at scale. He connects this to the importance of conformance suites and verification, noting skepticism when builds fail and credibility improves when instructions/tests are present. The implication is that “multi-agent” development is less about a single model and more about orchestration plus rigorous, automatable correctness signals.",

"whyItMatters": [
"Agent swarms can generate huge volumes of code, but credibility hinges on buildability, tests, and reproducible instructions.",
"Orchestration roles (planning, task decomposition, judging) map to new team patterns and platform requirements.",
"This pushes engineering toward stronger automated correctness signals to keep output reviewable."
],
"recommendedActions": [
"Strengthen conformance/test suites for critical components to make agent output measurable and reviewable.",
"Experiment with planner/worker patterns on well-bounded refactors and track rework rates.",
"Require “build from scratch” instructions in repos to reduce agent and human onboarding friction."
],
"risksAndCaveats": [
"This is a commentary/curation post; validate primary claims in the linked original sources before strategy changes.",
"Large-scale agent coding can inflate technical debt if verification and architecture governance lag."
